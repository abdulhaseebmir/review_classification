"The conspicuous flaw that marred our dining experience was the lamentable state of customer service. Regrettably, the waiter assigned to our table exhibited a most regrettable demeanor characterized by a remarkable lack of attentiveness and a discourteous disposition. To exacerbate matters, the initial act of securing a menu was an ordeal that entailed an inexplicable delay spanning an agonizing 20 minutes. Moreover, it was abundantly clear that the staff was more inclined to engage in convivial exchanges among themselves rather than earnestly attending to the needs of the clientele."
